# Win_ProcessManager
A simplified process manager for listing current running process and performing actions on them.

Processes are not retrived until executing 'View'

The window will list currently running processes, ordered by memory usage in MB

The App Title column displays the window title of the running application

Filter filters the list on 'name' only

Processes can be grouped by selected the 'Group By' radio button. This is usefull for handling many processes for one application such as multiple chrome processes per browser tab. When items are grouped, the PIDs are concatenated in one line and memory is summed.
